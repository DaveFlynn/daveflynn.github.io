## Quick Takeaways

- Reliable data is the key for organizations to make accurate and informed decisions
- To improve data reliability, start by assessing your current situation and then build a robust data infrastructure
- You need to clean existing data and then analyze and optimize new data creation and collection
- Data reliability improves when you break down data silos, integrate apps, organize your data, and employ robust reporting and dashboards

Unreliable data can cost a business in many ways. Experts estimate that between 60% to 85% of all business initiatives fail because of poor quality data. Thereâ€™s a real cost to unreliable data; Gartner reports that poor data quality costs the average organization between $9.7 million and $14.2 million each year. 

Reliable data helps decision-makers take the guesswork out of the day-to-day and strategic decisions they have to make to keep their businesses running. Without reliable data, those same decisions become more tenuous and less accurate, ultimately affecting the success of the business. 

## What is data reliability?

Data reliability means that data is complete and accurate, and it is a crucial foundation for building data trust across the organization. Ensuring data reliability is one of the main objectives of data integrity initiatives, which are also used to maintain data security, data quality, and regulatory compliance.
